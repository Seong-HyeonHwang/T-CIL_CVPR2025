# T-CIL: Temperature Scaling using Adversarial Perturbation for Calibration in Class-Incremental Learning
This repository contains the official implementation of our paper accepted at CVPR 2025.

## Abstract
T-CIL addresses the critical challenge of model calibration in class-incremental learning scenarios. Our approach combines temperature scaling with adversarial perturbations to maintain well-calibrated predictions as new classes are incrementally learned using only a new-task validation set.

## Quick start
```
# Run with default parameters
